# 📚 Library Management System in Java

This project is a **console-based Library Management System** built using Java. It helped me practice and understand **core Java concepts** like classes, objects, constructors, methods, and basic collection handling using `ArrayList`.

## 💡 What I Learned

### ✅ Java OOP Concepts
- **Classes and Objects:** Created `Book`, `User`, and `Library` classes.
- **Constructors:** Used to initialize object values.
- **Access Modifiers:** Used `private` for encapsulation and `public` getters/setters.
- **Method Calling:** Called methods like `addBook()`, `issueBook()`, etc.

### ✅ Java Collections
- Learned to use `ArrayList` to store multiple books and users.

### ✅ Conditional Logic & Loops
- Used `for-each` loops to search for books and users.
- Applied `if-else` logic for book issue and return validation.

### ✅ Object Interaction
- Managed interaction between `User`, `Book`, and `Library` using method calls.
